# Summary for week 11

This week I had to create framents for the scoreboard and the one used when, on the main menu, we select the radius.

The scoreboard was done without problem and the second fragment could have contained a view of the map with the red circle but time was running out and I decided to not add it this week to be able to deliver the app.
