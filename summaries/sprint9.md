# Summary for week 11


## Aloïs 



## Jeremy

This week I had to create framents for the scoreboard and the one used when, on the main menu, we select the radius.

The scoreboard was done without problem and the second fragment could have contained a view of the map with the red circle but time was running out and I decided to not add it this week to be able to deliver the app.

## Romain (Scrum Master)

This week I reworked the take picture and histroy activities into fragment to be able to use them with our new navigation activity. More importantly I improved the UI for both of their features.

Howerver, I underestimated the time for both of my task because I encounter a lot of issues from previous work.

Next time, I'll try to have less work assigned (both to me and the other as a scrum master) so we still have time to solve issues.
