# Summary for week 11


## Aloïs 

This week I implemented the UI for the map activity and did some refactoring.

This week I finished by wednesday all my tasks. Since we worked on the UI this week I was hoping that we could homogenized our work more notably on the floating buttons design.

Next time I should encourage more my team, during the last meating, to work on homogenizing our work. I should have for example came up in the last meating with proposal for the design of floating buttons for example.

## Jeremy

This week I had to create framents for the scoreboard and the one used when, on the main menu, we select the radius.

The scoreboard was done without problem and the second fragment could have contained a view of the map with the red circle but time was running out and I decided to not add it this week to be able to deliver the app.

## Léonard 

This week, I modified the activity that shows the picture to be guessed.

It took me the time expected but design choice were probably not optimal (color, view type, etc).

Next time, I should talk with the team to be sure we are accorded on the design to make.

## Nicolas 

This week I made a bottom navigation bar for the main menu of our app and a login/profile page.

I finished both those tasks, however I didn't expect it to be so time consuming: I had to refractor methods regarding the database, I had tests that wouldn't pass etc. That's why I greatly undersestimated the time I would need to do it.

Next time I will reflect more about my tasks and their needs before making time estimates.

## Pablo 

This week I implemented a feature to take a snapshot of the map with the user guess and the actual position of the picture so that it can be used in the history even if the user is offline.

However, I had major issues because the method I was using to take the snapshot was failing silently so I ended up rewriting some of my code.

Next time I will try to start with the hardest part of the task instead of the easiest one so that I can manage my time better if something goes wrong.

## Romain (Scrum Master)

This week I reworked the take picture and histroy activities into fragment to be able to use them with our new navigation activity. More importantly I improved the UI for both of their features.

Howerver, I underestimated the time for both of my task because I encounter a lot of issues from previous work.

Next time, I'll try to have less work assigned (both to me and the other as a scrum master) so we still have time to solve issues.


## Overall team

This week we successfully completed the user stories. Two of them had clear objective for which the feature was properly implemented. The last one had a more vague objective but in short it involed improving the UI and making it more uniform/consistent and easier to use. This was well done too with a navigation page that allow access to the main feature of the app, and round buttons with icon to perform the main possible action.

Howerver, as the user story about the UI was very open to interpretation we assigned quite a lot of work to every member of the team to be able to rework the whole UI. Most of us faced some issues while completing our tasks and because we already had enough (or more) work assigned we had to spend more time than what was planned on just completing these tasks and didn't have much time to be nitpicky about design details (colors, margins, etc.).

Next time we should make sure that the user story we want to complete is doable in one week or agree with the product owner that it will take some more time to be completed up to the details.
