## Romain 
I added a Guest button to allow user to use the app without signing in. I also helped Nicolas to finish implementing the picture backend and then added a scoreboard activity. 

However the scoreboard does not display as it should because I didn't find a good way to see the activity without actual data.

Next time, if I work on an activity I should find a way to display it even without data to verify that the UI looks like I expect it to.
