# Summary for week 5


## Aloïs (Scrum Master)

I implemented the map activity to guess a photo's location and managed to test it.

However, since working with a map arose unexpected issues I couldn't finish properly my second sprint task of the week. And as a Scrum Master I didn't give precise enough gidelines to my teammates so that we could merge efficienlty our work to display the full length of what we did during the week in the demo.

Next time, I will discuss with my teammates better so that they can merge at the end of the week directly display their work on the main app and demo.

## Jeremy

I added an activity that takes a photo and stores it in the gallery and my time estimate was almost on point.

However, I have noticed that there was some programming problems regarding what I've done last week.

Next time, I want to see if it is possible to correct what I did wrong before.


## Léonard

I modified the user implementation to add a way of getting the gps position of the phone.

However, I did not finished the test yet and my implementation lack some informations on how we will handle user permissions.

Next time, I will try to clarify everything with the team earlier about issues like this.

## Nicolas

I was able to finish the picture backend that was assigned to me for the last sprint plus I was able to finish the task I had to do for this spring.

However, I had a little trouble getting my test coverage right and Romain had to help me to for the finishing of it.

Next time, I will anticipate and make a higher time anticipation during the tasks assignment, thus taking into account the fact that testing takes a lot of time.

## Pablo

I implemented a function to reduce the precision of a picture location. Since this was a pretty short task, I also did some refactoring to use a single class to store locations across the app.

However, I did not start the UI part of the feature yet.

Next time, I will try to get more involved in pull request reviews for instance.

## Romain 
I added a Guest button to allow user to use the app without signing in. I also helped Nicolas to finish implementing the picture backend and then added a scoreboard activity. 

However the scoreboard does not display as it should because I didn't find a good way to see the activity without actual data.

Next time, if I work on an activity I should find a way to display it even without data to verify that the UI looks like I expect it to.

## Overall team

All main tasks for this week were finished before the end of the sprint.

However, we still underestimate in general the time that all the tasks take and couldn't finish all of them. It is also a shame that even though some of the task are done they are not present in the demo because not linked with the main app's activity yet. 

Next time, we will discuss as a teamm at the beginning of the week better so that at the end of the week each one of us can integrate their own work on the main app in a way that it will show direct results in the demo.
