# Summary for week 5


## Aloïs (Scrum Master)

I implemented the map activity to guess a photo's location and managed to test it.

However, since working with a map arised unexpected issues I couldn't finish properly my second sprint task of the week. And as a Scrum Master I didn't give prescise enough gidelines to my teammates so that we could merge efficienlty our work to display the full lenght of what we did during the week in the demo.

Next time, I will discuss with my teammates better so that they can by merging at the end of the week directly display their work on the main app and demo.

## Romain 
I added a Guest button to allow user to use the app without signing in. I also helped Nicolas to finish implementing the picture backend and then added a scoreboard activity. 

However the scoreboard does not display as it should because I didn't find a good way to see the activity without actual data.

Next time, if I work on an activity I should find a way to display it even without data to verify that the UI looks like I expect it to.
