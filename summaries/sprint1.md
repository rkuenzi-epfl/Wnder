# Summary for week 3


## Aloïs


## Jeremy (Scrum Master)

I implemented the possibility to upload data and images to a cloud.

However, I did not implement tests since I was waiting on Aloïs to give me images as inputs.

Next time, I will try not to wait to have usable data to use them when testing.

## Léonard

I Implemented a login screen that ask the user for a google account.

But my tests are not exhaustive because I did not take enough time to understand the Mockito and Hilt library.

For next time, I should spend more time testing my functions and doing it step by step.
