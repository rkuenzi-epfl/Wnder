# Summary for week 3


## Aloïs

I implemented the search of images through the Gallery but didn't managed to provide good test with it. 

It took me more time that expected to learn how Android GUI works which made me actually start implement my task only after our stand up meetings.

Next time, I will try to plan my work better so that the stand up meetings will be more beneficial for both my team and I. 

## Jeremy (Scrum Master)

I implemented the possibility to upload data and images to a cloud.

However, I did not implement tests since I was waiting on Aloïs to give me images as inputs.

Next time, I will try not to wait to have usable data to use them when testing.

## Léonard

I Implemented a login screen that ask the user for a google account.

But my tests are not exhaustive because I did not take enough time to understand the Mockito and Hilt library.

For next time, I should spend more time testing my functions and doing it step by step.

## Nicolas

I set up firebase and I implemented (with Romain) a first user backend differentiating signed in users and guests.

However, the backend wasn't put in relation with the work of my teammates, so it hasn't been tested at a global scale.

Next time, I will try to work more closely with my teammates so that I can understand their needs better and merge my work with theirs sooner.

## Pablo

I added the UI elements for the username and the profile picture to the main screen.

But I lost some time learning the very basics of Android GUI.

Next time I will try to start working on my task earlier in the week to get it reviewed before the end of the sprint.

## Romain

I implemented (with Nicolas) a basic backend to store information about the user (which might be guest or signed in) which should be globally accessible in the app.

However, the global accessiblity was not tested and not linked with the user interface.

Next time, I should try to merge my work with the rest of the team sooner to make sure of their compatibility.


## Overall team

We implemented almost all the issues that were assigned during the sprint.

However, we weren't able to merge our work correctly, so we weren't able to test the app in its entirety, because we didn't keep enough time to do it, plus not all of us were able to do complete tests on their respective sides.

Next time, we will make sure that we keep enough time to put our works together and that everything will be thouroughly tested beforehand.
