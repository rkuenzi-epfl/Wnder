# Summary for week 3


## Aloïs


## Jeremy (Scrum Master)

I implemented the possibility to upload data and images to a cloud.

However, I did not implement tests since I was waiting on Aloïs to give me images as inputs.

Next time, I will try not to wait to have usable data to use them when testing.
