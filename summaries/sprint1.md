# Summary for week 3


## Aloïs


## Jeremy (Scrum Master)

I implemented the possibility to upload data and images to a cloud.

However, I did not implement tests since I was waiting on Aloïs to give me images as inputs.

Next time, I will try not to wait to have usable data to use them when testing.

## Léonard

I Implemented a login screen that ask the user for a google account.

But my tests are not exhaustive because I did not take enough time to understand the Mockito and Hilt library.

For next time, I should spend more time testing my functions and doing it step by step.

## Nicolas


## Pablo

I added the UI elements for the username and the profile picture to the main screen.

But I lost some time learning the very basics of Android GUI.

Next time I will try to start working on my task earlier in the week to get it reviewed before the end of the sprint.

## Romain

I implemented (with Nicolas) a basic backend to store information about the user (which might be guest or signed in) which should be globally accessible in the app.

However, the global accessiblity was not tested and not linked with the user interface.

Next time, I should try to merge my work with the rest of the team sooner to make sure of their compatibility.
