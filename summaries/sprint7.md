# Summary for week 9


## Aloïs 


## Jeremy

This had to create a local database to store pictures and their metadata to have them available when the phone has no connection.

The first idea I had was not good so I had to start from scratch which costed me quite some time.

The line between my task and Nicolas' tasks were blurry so next time, I will make sure that the tasks are clearly defined for everyone.

## Léonard 


## Nicolas (Crum Master)


## Pablo 


## Romain 

This week I had to create a scoreboard which went pretty well. I also had to apply some of the advices from the code review.

However I knew I couldn't apply all the advices but still tried to do some of them that involved big architecture changes and therefore I spent too much time on it and the implementation is still incomplete.

Next time, I will try to do refactoring task progressivly through the weeks so that I don't end up having to spend so much time on it at once.
