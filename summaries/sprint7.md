# Summary for week 9

This had to create a local database to store pictures and their metadata to have them available when the phone has no connection.

The first idea I had was not good so I had to start from scratch which costed me quite some time.

The line between my task and Nicolas' tasks were blurry so next time, I will make sure that the tasks are clearly defined for everyone.
