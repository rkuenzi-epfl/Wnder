# Summary for week 9


## Aloïs 

This week I implemented the visualisation of the actual picture location on the map, finalise the flow between all the "guess a picture" routine and test it.

This time I was able to merge my work which was important for the demo soon enough. However I ended up having to do the merge for it pretty late because I had to wait for the reviews and corrections. I also wasn't able to implement my second task of the week since it depended of other collegue's tasks that took longer than expected.

Next time I should aim to merge one day earlier before the last stand up meeting (or we should do the meeting one day later) so that I don't end up merging so late into the week.

## Jeremy

This week I had to create a local database to store pictures and their metadata to have them available when the phone has no connection.

The first idea I had was not good so I had to start from scratch which costed me quite some time. This means I couldn't complete it on time.

The line between my task and Nicolas' tasks were blurry so next time, I will make sure that the tasks are clearly defined for everyone.

## Léonard 

This week I almost finished my task which was to display the history of guess of a particular user.

However I could finish it entirely because it relies on some functions from the database that I had to modify and are not working as expected.

Next time, I will see with the team if they can help me on this particular issue because the initial functions were not done by me.

## Nicolas (Crum Master)

This week I had to finish implementing some karma related-features and I had to prepare a class and an interface to read and store pictures in a local database.

The karma related features are done, however I wasn't able to completely finish and test the local database, as understanding how it should work took way more time than expected.

Next time, I will try to better estimate the time I need for a task and I will make sure the tasks are clearly defined, as mine were the same as Jeremy's ones for a few points.

## Pablo 

This week I had to implement an activity that shows information about previously guessed pictures.

While the UI is mostly done, I wasn't able to integrate it with the rest of the app because it depends on some pull requests which are still pending.

Next time, I will try to use placeholders more extensively so I can get my work merged independently from the rest.

## Romain 

This week I had to create a scoreboard which went pretty well. I also had to apply some of the advices from the code review.

However I knew I couldn't apply all the advices but still tried to do some of them that involved big architecture changes and therefore I spent too much time on it and the implementation is still incomplete.

Next time, I will try to do refactoring task progressivly through the weeks so that I don't end up having to spend so much time on it at once.


## Overall team

This week, we focused on completing the karma-related user story and the scoreboard one. We also began working on the local database and on the history one, which are closely related.

However, not all tasks were completed: some are pending PRs that we just didn't have time to merge and some still need a few hours of work. Moreover, some of the tasks really looked alike so it has been confusing for some members of the team.

Next time, we will have to do a better planning if we want to complete all of our tasks, may it be when we estimate the time they will take us or more simply when we create them.
