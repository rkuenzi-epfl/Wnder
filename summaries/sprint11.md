# Summary for week 6

This week I had to assigned tasks: I had to do the backend for the "tour" feature, and I had to add a button leading to the "tour" feature in the UI.

I made a pretty good time estimate for the backend, which I finished, I also fixed one or two bugs on the fly, however the button still not exists: I was surprised by the amount of work I had to put in that didn't relate to SDP, which led me to temporarily give up the button.

Next time I will better oranize myself to be able to finish all my tasks, even the short and not-so-demanding ones.

This week I had two task, the first was quite easy and I finished it in the time I estimated.

However the second was a bugfix for which I greatly underestimated the time required. Out of the three steps I determined I had to complete to fix the bug, I was only able to complete one and the others are still work in progress because they imply a lot of refactoring.

For next time (more like next project in this case), I think I (or we) should try to find and address bugs earlier in the process, because I realized that solving this bug earlier would have probably asked for less work than I does now.
