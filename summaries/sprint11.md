This week I had two task, the first was quite easy and I finished it in the time I estimated.

However the second was a bugfix for which I greatly underestimated the time required. Out of the three steps I determined I had to complete to fix the bug, I was only able to complete one and the others are still work in progress because they imply a lot of refactoring.

For next time (more like next project in this case), I think I (or we) should try to find and address bugs earlier in the process, because I realized that solving this bug earlier would have probably asked for less work than I does now.
