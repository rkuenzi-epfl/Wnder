# Summary for week 13


## Aloïs 

This week I had do modifiy the mapbox activity so that you can call it in its already implemented simple way but also in a new tour way which let the user guess a serie of pictures by walking to them.

I did underestimate my tasks this week which led me to have my PR ready late into the week. This is because I tried to tackle my work with a patern design that didn't fit in the end and I had to start over. The most annoying part to me is that I did the same mistake as last week which is not seperating enough my PRs. I realize only know, just before the end of the sprint, that I could have separated my PR in two and have one of them ready way earlier which would have lead to the merge on the main branch of at least a bit of my work.

Next time I should again separate my PRs better and instead of waiting to do a bigger PR I should separate in smaller PRs and just ask for reviews and merge instantly when the first part is done.

## Jeremy

This week I had to add a transition from the guess fragment in the main activity to the activity that lets the user select a tour. I also had to make the transition from the select tour activity to the guess activity in tour mode and make sure it has all the needed information.

The first one went without problems. In my second task I created a fake activity that only holds code for the transitions to the guess in tour mode and Alois' task has reunited both our tasks in the same PR since he needed my code that hasn't been merged when he started. Also I overestimated a bit this task since its wording let me think that I should have retrived all information for the tour but after discussion with Alois he only needed one id and simplified my task quite a lot.

Next time I will ask during the task assignments what people would exaclty need from me.

## Léonard

This week I fixed a bug that would lead the app to crash in case the permission were refused or the GPS disabled. My second task was to modify TakePictureFragment to allow the user to upload tours.

The second task was depending on other tasks and as I had not much time during the week, It was ready too late to be reviewed.

Next time, I should help people working on those other tasks to make the overall process less tedious.

## Nicolas

This week I had to assigned tasks: I had to do the backend for the "tour" feature, and I had to add a button leading to the "tour" feature in the UI.

I made a pretty good time estimate for the backend, which I finished, I also fixed one or two bugs on the fly, however the button still not exists: I was surprised by the amount of work I had to put in that didn't relate to SDP, which led me to temporarily give up the button.

Next time I will better oranize myself to be able to finish all my tasks, even the short and not-so-demanding ones.

## Pablo (Scrum Master)

## Romain 

This week I had two task, the first was quite easy and I finished it in the time I estimated.

However the second was a bugfix for which I greatly underestimated the time required. Out of the three steps I determined I had to complete to fix the bug, I was only able to complete one and the others are still work in progress because they imply a lot of refactoring.

For next time (more like next project in this case), I think I (or we) should try to find and address bugs earlier in the process, because I realized that solving this bug earlier would have probably asked for less work than I does now.
