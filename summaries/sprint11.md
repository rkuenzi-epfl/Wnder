# Summary for week 13


## Aloïs 

This week I had do modifiy the mapbox activity so that you can call it in its already implemented simple way but also in a new tour way which let the user guess a serie of pictures by walking to them.

I did underestimate my tasks this week which led me to have my PR ready late into the week. This is because I tried to tackle my work with a patern design that didn't fit in the end and I had to start over. The most annoying part to me is that I did the same mistake as last week which is not seperating enough my PRs. I realize only know, just before the end of the sprint, that I could have separated my PR in two and have one of them ready way earlier which would have lead to the merge on the main branch of at least a bit of my work.

Next time I should again separate my PRs better and instead of waiting to do a bigger PR I should separate in smaller PRs and just ask for reviews and merge instantly when the first part is done.

This week I had to assigned tasks: I had to do the backend for the "tour" feature, and I had to add a button leading to the "tour" feature in the UI.

I made a pretty good time estimate for the backend, which I finished, I also fixed one or two bugs on the fly, however the button still not exists: I was surprised by the amount of work I had to put in that didn't relate to SDP, which led me to temporarily give up the button.

Next time I will better oranize myself to be able to finish all my tasks, even the short and not-so-demanding ones.

This week I had two task, the first was quite easy and I finished it in the time I estimated.

However the second was a bugfix for which I greatly underestimated the time required. Out of the three steps I determined I had to complete to fix the bug, I was only able to complete one and the others are still work in progress because they imply a lot of refactoring.

For next time (more like next project in this case), I think I (or we) should try to find and address bugs earlier in the process, because I realized that solving this bug earlier would have probably asked for less work than I does now.
