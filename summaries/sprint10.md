# Summary for week 12


## Aloïs (Scrum Master)

This week I had to fix an issue where users who selected a small radius got the maximum number of points too easily. 

I also had to put a map in the guess fragment so that the user could know how far the pictures that were proposed to him were.

The first task was short to implement. The second took more time since it was my first time that working on mapbox. But in the end my time estimations were almost on point.
