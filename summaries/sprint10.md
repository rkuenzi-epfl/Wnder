# Summary for week 12


## Aloïs (Scrum Master)

This week I made a logo for the app and harmonized the UI.

I didn't have problems with my first task but I wish I could have done more for the second. I decided to wait and help for reviews and merge before finishing the last things I wanted to do. But doing that I ended up with a branch where the tests wouldn't pass anymore and I got stuck fixing that which used all my remaining time.

Next time I should separate my PRs better and instead of waiting to do a bigger PR I should separate in smaller PRs and just ask for reviews and merge instantly when the first part is done.

## Jeremy

This week I had to fix an issue where users who selected a small radius got the maximum number of points too easily. 

I also had to put a map in the guess fragment so that the user could know how far the pictures that were proposed to him were.

The first task was short to implement. The second took more time since it was my first time that working on mapbox. But in the end my time estimations were almost on point.

## Léonard

This week I modified the UI to add the possibility of saving the photos as well as some modification on the overall classes for the database.

The first two tasks went well but the last one was more surprising. The time estimate was almost correct for what I wanted to do, but as I did it a little bit late, I had to stop to begin the merging process earlier.

Next time, I should split my work in multiple tasks to avoid general purpose tasks that take too much time.

## Nicolas 

This week I added improvements to the location guessing activity (a "next guess" button and a little image in which you can zoom), I fixed a few bugs, and I refractored the GuessLocationActivity class that was really messy.

However, I finished my work pretty early in the week, and I didn't get back to it a bit later when everyone was merging their PRs, so I didn't check/approved many PRs, which means I let this part of the job to my teammates.

Next time, even if I finish my work early, I'll keep helping others reviewing and approving PRs later in the week, so that they don't have to do it alone.

## Pablo 

## Romain 

This week I made the camera usable when the user has no connection. I had to first let the user take the picture when he's disconnected, this was basically already implemented so it took me less time than I expected.

However my second task which let the uploads start later when the user had no connection at the moment he took the picture, was harder than I expected because I struggled with the documentation for firebase storage.

For next time I think I should put a time estimate after making sure I know more about the resources I need. 

## Overall team

This week we managed to do more or less what we wanted and finished up all the users stories. 

We still however created new PRs thursday which is the day before the sprint's end. If we don't want to work late that day we should get our PRs done by wednesday so that thursday we can focus on reviews and correction of issues/bugs.

Next time discussing a precise time when the PR should be ready could be a way to prevent that.
