# Summary for week 12


## Aloïs (Scrum Master)

This week I had to fix an issue where users who selected a small radius got the maximum number of points too easily. 

I also had to put a map in the guess fragment so that the user could know how far the pictures that were proposed to him were.

The first task was short to implement. The second took more time since it was my first time that working on mapbox. But in the end my time estimations were almost on point.

This week I made the camera usable when the user has no connection. I had to first let the user take the picture when he's disconnected, this was basically already implemented so it took me less time than I expected.

However my second task which let the uploads start later when the user had no connection at the moment he took the picture, was harder than I expected because I struggled with the documentation for firebase storage.

For next time I think I should put a time estimate after making sure I know more about the resources I need.
