# Summary for week 6


## Aloïs 

I did make the guess location activity secure by making the map's keys encrypted and finalized the guess activities calls.

This week I properly finished all my tasks but I got stuck on some points that cost me in the end a lot of time for how simple the solution was. Which is why, once again, I did underestimate the time my tasks actually took me. Romain did help with some of the issues. 

Next time, instead of wasting time on an issue for too long I will stop early my work and ask for help earlier so that my team members can help me see why I'm stuck. This way I will save time.
