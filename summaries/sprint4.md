# Summary for week 6


## Aloïs 

I did make the guess location activity secure by making the map's keys encrypted and finalized the guess activities calls.

This week I properly finished all my tasks but I got stuck on some points that cost me in the end a lot of time for how simple the solution was. Which is why, once again, I did underestimate the time my tasks actually took me. Romain did help with some of the issues. 

Next time, instead of wasting time on an issue for too long I will stop early my work and ask for help earlier so that my team members can help me see why I'm stuck. This way I will save time.

## Jeremy

This week, I refactored the Storage class which was not static and should  have been from the beginning. I also created a skeleton of all the activites we need for the app and made sure that all the transitions between activites were working.

## Léonard

I added some tests for my task and modified my implementation to get the location of the user.

However it took more time than expected because of some conflict with the permission mechanism of android.

Next time, I will be more direct with my implementation to avoid unnecessary problem.

## Nicolas

This week, I implemented a feature that lets a user choose the radius around him in which the next picture will be selected.

However, I didn't have time to finish and to merge it correctly, because I may have started to implement it a bit late.

Next time, I will make sure that I begin soon enough to be ready for the end of the sprint.

## Pablo (Scrum Master)

This week, I worked on the feature to show the actual picture location after confirming a guess.

However, I wasn't able able to get it merged because I had to rebase on top the main branch several times, and because the tests aren't passing for some reason.

## Romain 
I moved the classes handling users and pictures to separate packages and I simplified and improved the picture classes.

However, I did not manage to finish my other task (displaying the picture in the preview activity) and didn't find yet what the issue is.

This time I started working on my tasks later than usual and could not finished them or ask my teammates for help, so for next time I should start earlier again.
