# Summary for week 3

I added static functions to calculate a custom score and a distance with longitude and latitude given by google maps api type.

It took me less time than expected because the problems I had to resolve are some commons math problems.

Next time I should either take a bigger task or help the ones that are in trouble with the google maps api.
