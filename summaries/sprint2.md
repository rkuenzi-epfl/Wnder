# Summary for week 3


## Aloïs

## Jeremy

I have managed to finish implementing the functionnality to download and upload data to the cloud.

However, I did not have time to start the task I was assigned for this sprint.

## Léonard

I added static functions to calculate a custom score and a distance with longitude and latitude given by google maps api type.

It took me less time than expected because the problems I had to resolve are some commons math problems.

Next time I should either take a bigger task or help the ones that are in trouble with the google maps api.
