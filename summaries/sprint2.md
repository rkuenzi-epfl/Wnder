# Summary for week 4


## Aloïs

I did complete and finish testing the activity about selecting an image in the gallery.

Howerer, doing mock testing and doing my new task about the google map api is taking more time than anticipated

Next time I should evaluate better the time the task takes so that my work can be more useful for the end of the week demo.


## Jeremy

I have managed to finish implementing the functionnality to download and upload data to the cloud.

However, I did not have time to start the task I was assigned for this sprint.

## Léonard

I added static functions to calculate a custom score and a distance with longitude and latitude given by google maps api type.

It took me less time than expected because the problems I had to resolve are some commons math problems.

Next time I should either take a bigger task or help the ones that are in trouble with the google maps api. 

## Nicolas

I completed two backend classes that take care of pictures: one to upload a picture to the database and one to retrieve a picture. I also put in place some conventions to organize the data in the database, between firestore and cloud storage.

However, the part about cloud storage still misses one or two methods.

Next time, I'll try to think a bit further about the estimated time, because I definitely got it wrong this week.

## Pablo

## Romain (Scrum Master)

I first merged some of last week tasks that weren't merged yet (Login activity and the user backend), then I implemented my task for this week which was an activity to preview a new image we should get from cloud storage. Finally I assembled every activity we made so far.

My own task took me less time than expected but I spent a lot of time merging everyone's work.

Next time I should evaluate better the time my task takes me and make sure that the other know that I'm available to help if my task did not take to much time.

## Overall team

All the shorter task for this week were finished before the end of the sprint.

However, as we had to complete some of the tasks for last week some of this week tasks were left untouched because they asked way to much time to be done with the time we had left.

For next time we should try to have better time estimates in general.
