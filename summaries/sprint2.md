# Summary for week 3


## Aloïs

I did complete and finish testing the activity about selecting an image in the gallery.

Howerer, doing mock testing and doing my new task about the google map api is taking more time than anticipated

Next time I should evaluate better the time the task takes so that my work can be more useful for the end of the week demo.


## Jeremy

I have managed to finish implementing the functionnality to download and upload data to the cloud.

However, I did not have time to start the task I was assigned for this sprint.

## Léonard

I added static functions to calculate a custom score and a distance with longitude and latitude given by google maps api type.

It took me less time than expected because the problems I had to resolve are some commons math problems.

Next time I should either take a bigger task or help the ones that are in trouble with the google maps api.
