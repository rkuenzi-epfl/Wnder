This week I finished refractoring the getNewPicture in User and I added javadoc in every class that was available at the time I branched.

However I wasn't able to finish making sure an image loses karma when it's skipped. It works in practice but I spent useless hours trying to implement a test that never functionned.

Next time, I will try to do a better work at testing my tasks.
