# Summary for week 8


## Aloïs 

This week I implemented the initialisation default parameter for the guess activity and a red circle that indicate in which zone to guess.

My time estimate for the first task was good but when I finished it instead of pushing and merging it instantly with the main I extended what I wanted to do with the red circle feature. I shoudn't have done that since I had issued with merging the red circle feature which delayed the merging of the default parameter feature into the main branch. 

Next time I will separate my tasks better so that the essential features are ready and merged sooner with the main for the demo and my collegues.

This week, I implemented a system that chooses an image to show to the user based on the karma system.

I thought that my task would take me more time than it actually took me.

This week I finished refractoring the getNewPicture in User and I added javadoc in every class that was available at the time I branched.

However I wasn't able to finish making sure an image loses karma when it's skipped. It works in practice but I spent useless hours trying to implement a test that never functionned.

Next time, I will try to do a better work at testing my tasks.
