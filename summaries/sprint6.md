# Summary for week 8


## Aloïs 

This week I implemented the initialisation default parameter for the guess activity and a red circle that indicate in which zone to guess.

My time estimate for the first task was good but when I finished it instead of pushing and merging it instantly with the main I extended what I wanted to do with the red circle feature. I shoudn't have done that since I had issued with merging the red circle feature which delayed the merging of the default parameter feature into the main branch. 

Next time I will separate my tasks better so that the essential features are ready and merged sooner with the main for the demo and my collegues. 

## Jeremy

This week, I implemented a system that chooses an image to show to the user based on the karma system.

I thought that my task would take me more time than it actually took me.

## Léonard (Scrum Master)

This week I added the karma functions to modify karma on guessed pictures.

My other task was apparently already done by someone else (some missunderstanding I guess), so I took this time to review more PR this week to help finish the user stories.

Next time, I will try to take some more tasks to help more with the code.

## Nicolas

This week I finished refractoring the getNewPicture in User and I added javadoc in every class that was available at the time I branched.

However I wasn't able to finish making sure an image loses karma when it's skipped. It works in practice but I spent useless hours trying to implement a test that never functionned.

Next time, I will try to do a better work at testing my tasks.

## Overall team

Our main focus was our long standing user stories, which we successfully resolve (with maybe one or two tasks not merged now).

We encountered recuring problems with some tests that does not seem to work as intended and that slow us down for the merging process.

Next time, we should try to resolve our architecture/tests to make them less painful.
