# Summary for week 10


## Aloïs 



## Jeremy (Crum Master)



## Léonard 



## Nicolas 



## Pablo 



## Romain 

This week I first help Nicolas and Jeremy at the start of the sprint because I needed some of their code to complete my task then I completed my task in the estimated time.

However I did the reviews for Jeremy and Nicolas PR a bit late (compared to when they declared them ready) so I delayed starting my own task.

Next time, I will try to do the reviews as soon as possible so that no one (inluding myself) has to wait for merges.

## Overall team
