# Summary for week 10


## Aloïs 

This week I implemented my tasks that were about making the compass mode for the guess activity with the mapbox map.

I started working on it wednesday morning and tried to make the outline ready in time for the middle of the day which I did so that Leonard who had some logic work to do on the compass mode could start his work. I finished my global work by the end of the day but I misunderstood how the team wanted to use the sensor of the phone to move the map. Because of that I did spend time on some details that weren't absolutly necessary in my implementation instead of tackeling more important little UI features to make the activity prettier.

Next time instead of aiming to merge one day earlier again I should do my work right at the beginning of the week so that I give more time to my teammates and to myself to ask questions and be sure to not waste time by not understanding stuff.


## Jeremy (Scrum Master)


This week I had to implement a local database to access the history offline. I worked on this task with Nicolas since our tasks were roughly the same. I also had to make a function that finds out if the device is connected or not. My final task was to stop the user from doing stuff that required an internet connection. All of this was merged by wednesday to let time for other people to integrate my work into theirs.

As the scrum master of this week, I tried to encourage people to start their tasks sooner during the week and made sure people do not overload themselves in order to finish the user stories of the week.

However some miscommunication happened with Romain which lead him to believe that I had done one of his tasks without realizing it which caused him to start his task late.

Next time, I will make sure to be clear with other people about those kinds of issues.


## Léonard 

This week I finished my attributed tasks which were to implement some logic for the UI and my task from last week.

However I did not manage my time correctly this week. I was waiting for Aloïs works to have some support and general direction for the visual but it leads me to a rush on the last day last day.

Next time, I will not hesitate to use dummy setup to begin my tasks earlier and also to work on multiple PR if possible to avoid dead time.

## Nicolas 



## Pablo 



## Romain 

This week I first helped Nicolas and Jeremy at the start of the sprint because I needed some of their code to complete my task then I completed my task in the estimated time.

However I did the reviews for Jeremy and Nicolas PR a bit late (compared to when they declared them ready) so I delayed myself from starting my own task.

Next time, I will try to do the reviews as soon as possible so that no one (inluding myself) has to wait for merges.

## Overall team

This week the group managed to deliver all the user stories in the sprint backlog

The earliests PRs took quite a bit of time (a day or two) to get reviewed which slowed down the rest of the team since some people were waiting on features inside those PR to start. 

Some people didn't use those features in their work and continued using the old, deprecated methods which will complicate things in the long run.

Also people waited thursday evening to submit their work for review forcing people to stay up late to review and merge.
