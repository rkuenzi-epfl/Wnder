# Summary for week 7


## Aloïs 

This week I implemented the report button to report impossible images to guess.

I did estimate my time better this week but since the functions that my button uses are still to be implemented my button actually does nothing.
We will have to go back on my task to completly finish it once the functions names are known.

Next time I will try to agree with my teammates on some functions names so that even if they encounter problems I can still completly finish my work for the end of the sprint.

## Jeremy

This week I implemented the functionality of storing the karma of an image and a function that modifies it.

However I largely underestimated the amount of time needed to complete this task. I was assigned to an other task because I thought that I had enough to complete it, so I couldn't complete it (or even start it).

## Léonard

This week, I linked the database with our UI to make it possible to take a photo and then easily upload it on our DB.

It took me longer than expected because at first I was working on the wrong activity. Luckily some of my code was also working on the right one so I could make the necessary changes.

Next time, I will talk in more details with the person who created the activity I work in to know the goal of it.

## Nicolas

This week I implemented karma-related features, I made a clear map of the db organization, and I started refractoring the user classes.

However, the refractoring is taking more time than expected, and it's a bit harder to do than what I thought,

Next time, I'll try to start the refractoring sooner, and I won't let the smells accumulate.

## Pablo (Scrum Master)


## Romain 

This week I implemented a way to store and retreive reported pictures to the database.

However I should also have implemented a function to display the picture that was chosen for the user to guess but I could not get it to work properly even with some help from the team.
