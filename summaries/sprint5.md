# Summary for week 7


## Aloïs

This week I implemented the functionality of storing the karma of an image and a function that modifies it.

However I largely underestimated the amount of time needed to complete this task. I was assigned to an other task because I thought that I had enough to complete it, so I couldn't complete it (or even start it).

This week I implemented a way to store and retreive reported pictures to the database.

Howerver I should also have implemented a function to display the picture that was chosen for the user to guess but I could not get it to work properly even with some help from the team.
