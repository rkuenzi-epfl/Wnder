# Wnder
Wnder android app
The Wnder app is an app that propose pictures of your region to you so you can guess them by clicking or 
walking to the picture location. You can also guess tours that are series of pictures. You can also upload 
you own pictures and tours.

This repository contains all the files necessary to the wonder app except 2 that contains secret keys.
To make the app work one must add those two files locally:

- gradle.properties
- /app/src/main/res/values/secretStrings.xml

Once that is done you should be able to launch and fully use the Wnder app.
